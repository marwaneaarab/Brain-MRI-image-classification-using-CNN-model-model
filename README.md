#Alzheimer's Brain MRI Image Classification Using CNN Model
This project is an implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of Alzheimer's brain MRI images. The model was built using Python and Keras/TensorFlow.

#Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Alzheimer's Dataset - 4 Class of Images from Kaggle. It consists of 5,624 MRI images with 1,416 images of non-demented cases, 1,680 images of very mild dementia cases, 1,584 images of mild dementia cases, and 944 images of moderate dementia cases.

#Model
The CNN model was built using Keras/TensorFlow and consists of several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by two fully connected layers and a softmax output layer. The model was trained on the entire dataset using a batch size of 32 and a total of 300 epochs.

Evaluation
The trained model achieved an accuracy of 92% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying Alzheimer's brain MRI images.
