# Brain-MRI-image-classification-using-CNN-model-model
The CNN model was built using Keras/TensorFlow and consists of several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by two fully connected layers and a softmax output layer. The model was trained on the entire dataset using a batch size of 32, an initial learning rate of 0.001, and a total of 200 epochs.
